# Twitter Dalek

This Dalek goes through and deletes any Tweets older than a week. Twitter's API/Rate Limiting isn't what it used to be - you can obtain up to 3 months of Tweets via the API - but you can obtain the set via a Download Link in your Settings.

The following Environment Variables can be set, which can be obtained through a Twitter Application:

* `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY` - The Consumer Key for the Twitter Application
* `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET` - The Consumer Secret for the Twitter Application
* `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN` - The Access Token from the Twitter Application
* `TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET` - The Access Secret from the Twitter Application
* `TWITTER_USERNAME` - Your Twitter username
